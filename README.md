# World Weather Analysis

This project used several APIs to help plan a trip for a mock app called PlanMyTrip. I scraped weather data from all around the globe using OpenWeather's API to put together a database of ideal cities based on temperature. I then used Google Maps Directions API to search for the closest hotels in those cities and planned a mock trip traveling to 4 different cities, and showed the itinerary using a pin location map. 

APIs are powerful and extremely useful for a myriad of applications!
